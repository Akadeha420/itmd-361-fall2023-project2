        <h3>Hobbies & Interests</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Travel
            <p>This is my first attempt studying abroad so I enjoy traveling during the holidays and visiting new
              places.
              I have plans to visit all the states in the US before I graduate but it is now looking kind of unlikely.
            </p>

          </li>
          <li>Dota 2 & Fifa
            <p>Aside from traveling, I play a lot of video games in my free time but most of my gaming-hours contribute
              toward Dota 2 and Fifa 23</p>

          <li>Education & Career Paths
            <p>Although I've chosen CS as my major, I am very much interested in either Front-end or Full-stack rather
              than Back-end and I am looking towards working with Web Development</p>
